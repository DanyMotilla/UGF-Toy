# YARN - WebGL SDF Renderer

This project aims to consolidate different versions of the UGF-oriented modeling library from ShaderToys and LatticeRobot into a single, clean implementation. It provides a modern, React-based interface for real-time SDF (Signed Distance Field) rendering using WebGL.

## Features

- Real-time SDF rendering using custom GLSL shaders
- Interactive 3D scene manipulation
- TypeScript + React implementation for type safety and component reusability
- Vite-powered development environment with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

## Technology Stack

- React + TypeScript
- WebGL / GLSL Shaders
- Vite build system
- Modern ESLint configuration

## Development

This project uses Vite with TypeScript and React. To get started:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
